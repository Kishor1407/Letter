Welcome to the Animated Letter App repository on GitHub! This project showcases a dynamic and visually captivating
application built entirely with HTML and CSS. By leveraging a combination of CSS techniques including transitions, 
transforms, animations, grid layout, and flexbox, this app brings letters to life through mesmerizing animations.

The app is thoughtfully animated using CSS transitions and transforms, resulting in a delightful visual experience 
for users. The layout of the letters is carefully crafted using CSS grid layout, ensuring a visually appealing
arrangement that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes thanks to the flexibility of flexbox.

Furthermore, the use of keyframe animations adds an extra layer of smoothness and sophistication to the letter
animations, enhancing the overall user experience. The codebase is meticulously organized and well-documented,
making it easy for developers to understand, modify, and extend the functionality of the app for their own projects.

Contributions to the project are encouraged and welcomed! Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or
improving the existing codebase, contributors can follow the outlined steps to fork the repository, make their
changes, and submit pull requests for review.
